# Hobnobs layout

## Aim/desired features

- remain QWERTYish to minimise the pain of swapping
  - QWERTY primary layer
  - number and symbol row largely unchanged
  - shift on pinkys
- optimise the symbol layer for R and Vim (also Python/Shell/Markdown/MathTex)
  - R
    - annoying symbols like <- and %>% are best bound to editor shortcuts (HYPER+< and HYPER+>)
    - \# and _ for comments and tidyverse functions
- minimal and comfortable finger movement
  - bilateral access to as many modifiers as possible
  - have common layer symbols on the opposite side to the layer key
  - easy access to HYPER and MEH for program specific keybinds


## implications for design
letters, numbers and symbols as the are on qwerty to keep the transition easy

- number layer to include calculator symbol and a numpad 
- symbol layer aiming to be qwerty number row ish?
- function keys stay in numbers or own layer?
- adjust layer

new homes needed for 8 keys / 16 symbols - without duplicates should fit nicely on symbol layer:
`¬
-_
=+
{[
}]
'@
#~
\|

could tap dance closing brackets as these are generally autoclosed for me anyway?
